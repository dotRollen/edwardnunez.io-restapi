# My Personal Website Back End

This is my personal website back end RESTful API service built with `Flask` library. This RESTful API is used for authentication, data and many other cool endpoints. The[edwardnunez.io-web](https://github.com/dotRollen/edwardnunez.io-web) repo is where the web interface is hosted and consumes this RESTful API.
