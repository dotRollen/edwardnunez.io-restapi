# My Personal Website Back End

This is my personal website front end interface built with `React.js` and served on Express.js. This single page application consumes and posts data to my RESTful API at [edwardnunez.io-restapi](https://github.com/dotRollen/edwardnunez.io-restapi). I use this website to display my portfolio and build neat tools that I like to share with friends and family.
